### 1. Build and locally install gRPC and Protocol Buffers using cmake.
Choose a directory to hold locally installed packages. This page assumes that the environment variable MY_INSTALL_DIR holds this directory path.

$ export MY_INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/.local
$ mkdir -p $MY_INSTALL_DIR
$ export PATH="$MY_INSTALL_DIR/bin:$PATH"

The CSL machines already have cmake installed. Verify this with
$ cmake --version

### 2. Clone the repo
$ git clone --recurse-submodules -b v1.43.0 https://github.com/grpc/grpc

### 3. Installation
The following commands build and locally install gRPC and Protocol Buffers:
$ cd grpc
$ mkdir -p cmake/build
$ pushd cmake/build
$ cmake -DgRPC_INSTALL=ON \
      -DgRPC_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$MY_INSTALL_DIR \
      ../..
$ make -j 4
$ make install
$ popd

### 4. Build example
Change to the exampleâ€™s directory:
$ cd examples/cpp/helloworld

Build the example using cmake
$ mkdir -p cmake/build
$ pushd cmake/build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$MY_INSTALL_DIR ../..
$ make -j 4

### 5. Run the client and the server
On one terminal, run the server as follows
$ ./greeter_server

On another terminal,
$ ./greeter_client

### 6. Modify proto
Replace the contents of examples/protos/helloworld.proto with the contents of helloworld.proto provided here in part3 and make 
$make -j 4

### 7. Modify client and server
Inside the examples/cpp/helloworld/ replace greeter_server.cc and greeter_client.cc with the files with the same name provided here in part3 and make.

### 8. Get the measurements
Make changes to the helloworld/cmake/build/helloworld.pb.cc file to log the marshalling and unmarshalling overheads. For every request time, there is a <requestType>::InternalSerialize and <requestType>::InternalParse which performs the packing and unpacking respectively. Copy over the contents of the helloworld.pb.cc provided in part3/grpc into that file and run
$ make -j 4
Repeat step 5 to get RTT measurements
This will generate files with measurements from marshalling/unmarshalling overheads and RTT time for 100 requests with different payloads, and also print the mean RTT and bandwidth to the standard console.
Please note, are the measurements are in nanoseconds.

### 9. Run on different machines
For running the client on a separate machine, ssh into another machine, royal-13 for instance, and navigate to examples/cpp/helloworld/cmake.build
$ ./greeter_client --target=royal-13.cs.wisc.edu:50051

### 10. Compiler optimization,
Add the following in CMakeLists.txt under # Options
add_compile_options(-O3)
make clean and repeat step 1,3,4,5 to get measurements
