# UW-CS739-Project1

## Part 0
Shown in part0/timing.cpp.
Comparison with clock_gettime can be done by replacing chrono calls with those of clock_gettime

## Part 1
Unless otherwise noted, all measurements are done from part1/part1.cpp
* L1 cache reference: lines 72-109
* Branch misprediction: Could not figure out good way to measure
* L2 cache reference: lines 72-82, 111-148
* Mutex lock/unlock: lines 170-182
* Main memory reference: lines 150-168
* Read 1MB from memory: lines 184-194
* Compress 1K with Zippy (now Snappy): lines 196-212
* Send 1K over 1Gbps link: lines 263-276
* RTT within the same datacenter: ping -c 10 royal-13.cs.wisc.edu
* Reading 1MB sequentially from SSD/HDD: lines 214-238
* Read 4K randomly from SSD/Disk: lines 240-261
* Packet from Madison->Netherlands->Madison: ping -c 10 government.nl


## Part 2
- The library code is in `part2/comm.hpp`
A. Performance
    1. Overhead
        - Since we use tcpdump, this part is not fully automatic, so it's not entirely in code.
        - See the commented out lines at `recv` and `send` in `comm.hpp`, where we insert clock function and calculate time difference with the timestamp from tcpdump.
    2.  Roundtrip
        - See `part2/client.cpp` `argv[1][0] == '1'` part
    3. Bandwidth 
        - See `part2/client.cpp` `argv[1][0] == '2'` and `argv[1][0] == '3'` part
    4. Running on different machine
        - See `part2/client.cpp` where it can take a hostname as an argument
    5. Improvement
       - See `sendbig` and `recvbig` in `part2/comm.hpp`
B. Reliability.
    1, 2. Packet drop
        - See `recv` in `part2/comm.hpp`
    3. Same as A-2 but with packet drop
C. Compiler Optimization
    - See `part2/Makefile`
    
## Part 3

Thrift:
Refer to the Thrift code in `part3/thrift/` folder.
    1. Marshalling and Unmarshalling of various data types: Method `marshallUnmarshallMsgs` (lines 184-409 of Client.cpp)
    2. Round Trip time calculation: Method `roundTripTimeCalc` (lines 58-155 of Client.cpp)
    3. Total Bandwidth: Method `bandwidthCalc` (lines 157-182 of Client.cpp)
Change the hostname in line 414.
For details regarding thrift, refer to the README.md file in the `part3/thrift/` folder.
