## Part 0
## Part 1


## Part 2
- The library code is in `part2/comm.hpp`
A. Performance
    1. Overhead
        - Since we use tcpdump, this part is not fully automatic, so it's not entirely in code.
        - See the commented out lines at `recv` and `send` in `comm.hpp`, where we insert clock function and calculate time difference with the timestamp from tcpdump.
    2.  Roundtrip
        - See `part2/client.cpp` `argv[1][0] == '1'` part
    3. Bandwidth 
        - See `part2/client.cpp` `argv[1][0] == '2'` and `argv[1][0] == '3'` part
    4. Running on different machine
        - See `part2/client.cpp` where it can take a hostname as an argument
    5. Improvement
       - See `sendbig` and `recvbig` in `part2/comm.hpp`
B. Reliability.
    1, 2. Packet drop
        - See `recv` in `part2/comm.hpp`
    3. Same as A-2 but with packet drop
C. Compiler Optimization
    - See `part2/Makefile`
